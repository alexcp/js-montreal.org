# JS-MONTREAL.ORG

This repo contains the code for the js-montreal.org website.

It could definitely use a lot of improvement. Fork and send me a pull request!.

The site currently runs on Sinatra, on my Dreamhost server. I wouldn't mind moving it to Heroku.  Or moving it to
a host that's got Node JS on it or another server side JS platform, because after all this is a JS user group. I'm
open to suggestions.

Log your suggestions using the issues panel. The site exist for the group, help us make it more useful. I'm going to log a
few issues myself. If you feel like taking them on, let me know!
