1. Why?

  * Site is two years old.
  * No reason, tired of looking at it.
  * Wanted to play with Twitter Bootstrap

2. What's under the hood

  * Twitter Bootstrap

    * Why?

      - Because it looks pretty good, and after using it
      at work for another project, thought it was
      quite usable.

      - Started putting together a JavaScript component
      for Bootstrap when it came out; was quickly beaten
      to the punch by the Twitter developers.

        My name for it was "Twitter Laces"

  * The existing backend

    Ruby w/ Sinatra
    All the data is stored in JSON files


  * Features you'd like to see (DISCUSS)

    - Jobs board
      - Have people pay beer money for placement.

    - Member list?
      LinkedIn integration??????


3. Help pls.


  * Question: Do you have a github account?

    Yes : [x]
    No  : [ ]

    "DEMONSTRATION"


  * TODO
    - Design. Design. Design.
    - Features
    - Porting to NodeJS? Another option?   -  Martin Drapeau

    - RADIFICATION (not rad enough)

4. Final words

  - It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.
